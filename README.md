# Open Directory Downloader
Indexes open directories listings in 100+ supported formats, including FTP, Google Drive, GoIndex (alternatives).

Written in C# with .NET Core, which means it is **cross platform**!

Downloading is not (yet) implemented, but is already possible when you use the resulting file into another tool (for most of the formats).

Downloading with wget:
`wget -x -i theurlsfile.txt`

Downloading with [aria2c](https://aria2.github.io/) (Does not support directory structure..):
`aria2c -i theurlsfile.txt`

If you have improvements, supply me with a pull request! If you have a format not yet supported, please let me know.

## Prerequisites

## Docker

DockerHub avaiable here: [OpenDirectoryDownloader](https://hub.docker.com/r/ralane/opendirectorydownloader)

> Need persistent storage for your json or url files? Create a volume for `/app/OpenDirectoryDownloader/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/Scans`.

### Building Docker

1. Clone repository
2. Go to main folder
3. Run `docker build . -t opendirectorydownloader` initially, or whenever you updated the code
4. Run `docker run --rm -it opendirectorydownloader` whenever you want a scan

## Getting the code

### For Visual Studio (Windows)
1. Install Visual Studio: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/
* With workload: ".NET Core cross-platform development"
* With individual components: Code tools > Git for Windows and Code tools > GitHub extension for Visual Studio
2. Be sure to install Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads
3. Clone the repository by clicking "Clone or download" and click "Open in Visual Studio"

### For Visual Studio Code
1. Download Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
2. Be sure to install Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads
3. Clone the repository: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol#_cloning-a-repository
4. More help: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/with-visual-studio-code

## Building
1. Install the newest .NET Core 3.1 SDK. 
2. `git clone https://github.com/KoalaBear84/OpenDirectoryDownloader`
3. `cd OpenDirectoryDownloader/OpenDirectoryDownloader`
4. `dotnet build .`
5. `cd bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1`
6. `./OpenDirectoryDownloader --url "https://myopendirectory.com"`

For Linux:
Then, if you need to package it into a binary, you can use [warp-packer](https://github.com/dgiagio/warp#quickstart-with-net-core)

When you have cloned the code, you can also run it without the SDK. For that, download the ["Runtime"](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) and do "`dotnet run .`" instead of build.

## Google Drive
For Google Drive scanning you need to get a Google Drive API credentials file, it's free!

You can use a many steps manual option, or the 6 steps 'Quickstart' workaround.

Manual/customized:

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate
2. Fill in Project Name, like "opendirectorydownloader" or so, lease Location unchanged
3. Change Project ID (optional)
4. Click "CREATE"
5. Wait a couple of seconds until the project is created and open it (click "VIEW")
6. On the APIs pane, click "Go to APIs overview"
7. Click "ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES"
8. Enter "Drive", select "Google Drive API"
9. Click "ENABLE"
10. Go to "Credentials" menu in the left menu bar
11. Click "CONFIGURE CONSENT SCREEN"
12. Choose "External", click "CREATE"
13. Fill in something like "opendirectorydownloader" in the "Application name" box
14. At the bottom click "Save"
15. Go to "Credentials" menu in the left menu bar (again)
16. Click "CREATE CREDENTIALS"
17. Select "OAuth client ID"
18. Select "Desktop app" as "Application type"
19. Change the name (optional)
20. Click "Create"
21. Click "OK" in the "OAuth client created" dialog
22. In the "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs" section click on the just create Desktop app line
23. In the top bar, click "DOWNLOAD JSON"
24. You will get a file like "client_secret_xxxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com.json", rename it to "OpenDirectoryDownloader.GoogleDrive.json" and replace the one in the release

Wow, they really made a mess of this..

Alternative method (easier):

This will 'abuse' a 'Quickstart' project.

1. Go to https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/python
2. Click the "Enabled the Drive API"
3. "Desktop app" will already be selected on the "Configure your OAuth client" dialog
4. Click "Create"
5. Click "DOWNLOAD CLIENT CONFIGURATION"
6. You will get a file like "credentials.json", rename it to "OpenDirectoryDownloader.GoogleDrive.json" and replace the one in the release

On the first use, you will get a browser screen that you need to grant access for it, and because we haven't granted out OAuth consent screen (This app isn't verified), we get an extra warning. You can use the "Advanced" link, and use the "Go to yourappname (unsafe)" link.
